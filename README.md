## PyTorch Implementation of an Encoder-only Transformer

This code implements a Transformer-Encoder model (for a detailed description of an encoder-decoder transformer architecture refer Vaswani et al., 2017) for Kaggle's "CommonLit Readability Prize" challenge and the source data sets can be downloaded from Kaggle's website. While BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) is also a Transformer-Encoder model, this implementation is not the same as fine-tuning BERT because -- 
1. it does not estimate the token embeddings and instead uses GloVe embeddings (https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/);
2. it does not make use of masking during the training process; and
3. it makes the use of position-based encoding optional.

Consequently, the current implementation aims to facilitate an understanding of the encoder-based architecture for predictive modelling. It can be used to explore the change in RMSE owing to an inclusion/exclusion of position-based encoding and a change in the -- 
1. number of input dimensions in an attention layer;
2. number of attention heads;
3. number of dimensions in the feedforward network; or
4. number of encoder layers.
